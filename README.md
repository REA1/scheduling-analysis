# Computer-Aided Proof for Scheduling Algorithms

The anlaysis of certain scheduling algorithms can be finally reduced to the inspection of finite cases. It is extremely tedious task for human to inspect case by case when the number of cases is very large.

Hence, we write program to automatically inspect the cases to aid the proof.
